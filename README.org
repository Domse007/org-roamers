#+title: org-roam-rs

This projects consists of two libraries:
- =org-roam-rs=: this is the elisp part of the package.
- =org-roam-utils=: this is the rust part of the packages, which will
  get loaded by emacs.

The names are subject to change.

* Setup
All files required by emacs can be built using make:

#+begin_src sh
make all
#+end_src

After loading the package, we first have to initialize the rust data
structures:

#+begin_src elisp
(org-roam-rs-init)
#+end_src

Then the database can be constructed. This may take some time.

#+begin_src elisp
(org-roam-rs-migrate)
#+end_src

* Usage
An alternative to the =org-roam-node-find= is provided with
=org-roam-rs-helm-node-find=.

Currently only a helm backend is provided, which can be used with the
command =M-x org-roam-rs-company=, or by enabling the =org-roam-rs-mode=.
